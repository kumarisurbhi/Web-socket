# Web-socket
A TCP socket to send/receive information between two hosts (client and server).
Socket itself is just endpoints to a communication.

Socket sits on the ip on some port or we can say it is attached to some port on the server (server has some IP address by which we find or locate it)
In this socket a stream of bytes is send and received and then encoded.
